# Data Warehouse for Medical Clinic

## Project Overview

This project is designed to create a robust data warehouse for a medical clinic, allowing for effective data management, analysis, and reporting. It includes the design, implementation, and optimization of a data warehouse, along with the necessary scripts and documentation to support business processes.

## Contents

- `DataGenerator`: A tool or script to generate mock data for testing the data warehouse.
- `DataWarehouseDesign.pdf`: The document outlining the design of the data warehouse.
- `DataWarehouseImplementation`: Folder containing the implementation details of the data warehouse.
- `DataWarehouseOptimization.pdf`: A document detailing the steps taken to optimize the performance of the data warehouse.
- `MDX.pdf`: Documentation on MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) queries used within the data warehouse.
- `Specyfikacja_procesow_biznesowych.pdf`: Business process specification in Polish.
- `Specyfikacja_wymagan_dla_procesu_biznesowego.pdf`: Requirements specification for a business process in Polish.
- `Specyfikacja_wymagan_dla_procesu_biznesowego_wizyty_pacjentow1.docx`: Another document specifying requirements for the business process of patient visits, in Polish and in Word format.
- `create.sql`: SQL script for creating the database schema.
- `etl`: Folder that presumably contains ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts or tools.
- `powerbi.pbix`: A Power BI file for data visualization and business intelligence reporting.
- `relational_database.jpg`: An image of the relational database schema.
- `scripts`: Folder containing additional scripts used in the project.
- `sources`: Folder that might contain source files or data used in the data warehouse.

## Setup

Detailed instructions on setting up the project are not provided in this overview. However, one can expect to:

1. Execute the `create.sql` script to set up the initial database schema.
2. Use the `DataGenerator` to populate the database with mock data.
3. Refer to the `DataWarehouseDesign.pdf` and `DataWarehouseImplementation` directory for the architectural design and implementation details.
4. Run the ETL processes within the `etl` directory to populate the data warehouse.
5. Open the `powerbi.pbix` file in Power BI for data visualization and analysis.

## Documentation

The project comes with comprehensive documentation:

- Design, implementation, and optimization guides are provided in PDF format.
- Business process specifications and requirements are documented, although they are in Polish.
- An MDX guide is included for advanced data querying.

## Requirements

- SQL Server or a compatible database system to execute the `create.sql` script.
- ETL tooling (details should be within the `etl` directory).
- Power BI Desktop to use the provided `.pbix` file.
